  During my Java internship at CodTech, I had the opportunity to work on Task 4, which involved designing and implementing a recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout. The goal of this project was to create an intelligent system capable of suggesting products or content based on user preferences. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in various industries, from e-commerce platforms suggesting products to streaming services recommending movies and music. This task required a deep understanding of collaborative filtering techniques, which analyze user behavior to provide personalized recommendations.
  To build this system, I used Apache Mahout, a powerful machine learning library that specializes in building scalable recommendation models. The first step was to prepare and load the dataset, which contained information about user interactions, including user IDs, item IDs, and ratings. This dataset served as the foundation for training the recommendation model. Next, I implemented collaborative filtering by utilizing Pearson Correlation Similarity, a technique used to measure relationships between different users. By identifying similarities, the system could determine which users had shared interests and generate recommendations accordingly. Additionally, I incorporated UserNeighborhood-based filtering, which helped refine suggestions by focusing on users with closely related preferences. The final stage of the implementation involved using Mahoutâ€™s GenericUserBasedRecommender, which processed the data and provided personalized recommendations for each user.
  This project significantly enhanced my knowledge of machine learning algorithms, data processing, and AI-driven applications. Working with Apache Mahout gave me hands-on experience in big data handling and recommendation system design, which are widely used in modern technology-driven businesses. Furthermore, the project allowed me to strengthen my skills in managing external Java libraries, working with structured datasets, and handling dependencies using Maven. Completing this task provided me with valuable insights into how recommendation engines work and how they improve user experience through personalized suggestions.
